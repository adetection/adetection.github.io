## Welcome to A-Detection

A-Detection is a software developed to automate the analysis of network anomalies in large dataframes. Thanks to a series of algorithms, A-Detection can detect anomalous data and display it in dynamic graphics.

### How it works

A-Detection imports network traffic, and based on a series of algorithms like; Variable Scaling and Isolation Forest, is able to normalize data and detect anomalies in the dataframe.

#### Data import

The first step is to import all the data to start playing.

```markdown
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv('/home/alexfrancow/netflow.json')
```

#### Data group

At this point we basically tell the application to count the packets that have the same IP and the same protocol in a time period of 5 seconds.

```markdown
ipdst           proto   time                   count
10.3.20.102     HTTP    2017-03-20 17:08:56     1
10.3.20.102     HTTP    2017-03-20 17:08:57     1
10.3.20.102     HTTP    2017-03-20 17:08:58     1
10.3.20.102     HTTP    2017-03-20 17:08:58     1
10.3.20.102     TCP     2017-03-20 17:08:59     3
```

```markdown
df.set_index('time').groupby(['ipdst','proto']).resample('5S').sum().reset_index()
```

```markdown
  ipdst       proto  time                 count     
    -           -    2017-03-20 17:08:50    0
10.3.20.102    HTTP  2017-03-20 17:08:55    4
10.3.20.102    TCP   2017-03-20 17:08:55    4
    -           -    2017-03-20 17:09:00    0
```

#### Data normalization

An approach to Z-score normalization (or standardization) is the so-called **Min-Max scaling**.
In this approach, the data is scaled to a fixed range - usually 0 to 1.

#### Aply the Isolation Forest algorithm

The IsolationForest ‘isolates’ observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.
